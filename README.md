Instagram Followers Crawler

Crawler pulls the data from Google Sheets. Sheet is configured as follows:
Name -> Name of the user/account (optional)
Link -> URL to the IG profile to keep track of followers (required)
type_of_media -> instagram. In the future I'll add twitter, so you can choose between instagram and twitter
type_of_account -> if you want to separate different types of accounts(influencers,singers,athletes,etc.)

After pulling required data Crawler loops through all accounts and scrape followers count. This data will be automatically appended to specified sheet.

How to use it?

First you'd have to specify type_of_media, type_of_account and sheet_to_update(this is name of the tab where you want to append Crawler results)
crawler = Crawler(type_of_media="instagram",
                  type_of_account="athletes",
                  sheet_to_update="athletes_sheet")

By calling function crawl() Crawler will pull the athletes Instagram accounts from your sheet and scrape followers count.
followers_df = crawler.crawl()

By calling function update_spreadsheet() Crawler will append dataframe to specified sheet_to_update
crawler.update_spreadsheet(followers_df)
